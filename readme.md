This code was created for the master thesis titled: "Identifying, Mitigating and Attacking risks in Retrieval Augmented Generation". It features a comprehensive RAG system with multiple mitigation techniques for the risks of data leaks and knowledge poisoning, as well as two novel attacks targeting these risks. The RAG.py file is the main file that can be used to recreate both the RAG system from this thesis, as well as the two novel attacks. Additionally, the files in the folder 'helper scripts' and the file 'visualization.py' have been used to calculate the results we used in this thesis. In order to run the main RAG.py file, one needs to first install every dependency in requirements.txt, as well as install llama3.1 using ollama.
