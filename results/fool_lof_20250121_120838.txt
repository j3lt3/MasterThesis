Thursday Meeting Phillip, We spoke with Ina and scheduled a meeting with you for this Thursday from 10:00 - 11:00 in Room 3267 of the Enron Building. The purpose of this meeting will be to get your sign-off on the feedback approach for the simulation. We have outlined, in greater detail than you and I have previously discussed, what we will provide feedback on and how we will provide it for each scenario. It will be important for us to get your input on Thursday because we need to finalize the feedback structure before we can begin building the course. If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at Ext. 5-6676. Mery
