We will move Conversion and Arbitrage from the Simulation layer into the Knowledge System layer. We will incorporate 5-10 problems of each type. 2. You will provide us with the name(s) of people who can give us content for these problems. We will set up two rounds of meetings; one early next week to gather content and a second meeting for review. 3. We will change \"Gas Daily Risk\" to \"Intra-Month Risk\" throughout the simulation. Can you provide us with a definition of Intra-Month risk? 4. Just to clarify: For conversion, we were planning to cover problems where there is no perfect hedge so the learner has to find creative ways to hedge, as opposed to conversion of mmBTU to decatherms, conversion of oil volumes to natural gas volumes, etc. Is that what you had in mind too?

Review and document systems and processes - The handoffs from ERMS, TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the parties trying to make improvements. I think I understand ERMS and TAGG but the issues facing scheduling in Unify are grey. 2. Review and audit complex deals- Under the \"assume it is messed up\" policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need further scrutiny. 3. Review risk books- Is Enron accurately accounting for physical imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions? 4.

The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. \"Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,\" said William Burson, a trader. \"It makes the market for natural gas.\" But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality. \"It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what we are reporting,\" McGill said. As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at Wall Street. Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for the rise in gas prices. \"It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,\" Adik told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes. Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared. \"We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,\" said Paul Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. \"There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to change,\" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. Hot topic Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In many circles, little else is discussed. The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as well. The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. \"It's the talk of the town here,\" he said. A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by customers. But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter. There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas markets. \"It's all about the weather,\" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile commodity in the world. Setting the price In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had widespread influence over gas prices. The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what they pay for the gas they expect to use. There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge of natural gas. But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time. As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's weekly storage numbers. Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter. Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. \"I was getting worried,\" he said. Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. Just passing through Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers. Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve energy. Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to save an average customer about $25 this winter. Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs. On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. \"Consumers are taking all the risk,\" Micheel said. \"It's time to consider some changes.\" To reach Steve Everly, call (816) 234-4455 or send e-mail to severly@kcstar.com. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -- All content , 2001 The Kansas City Star Subject: Forbes Article-Gas Fired Power Plants From: ken.shulklapper@enron.com Date: Fri, 19 Oct 2001 13:08:22 -0700 (PDT) Don't know if you saw this already.

(A million Btu of gas equals just about 1,000 cubic feet.) Those new gas plants were supposed to steal business from pollution-spewing coal units, which still supply half the nation's electricity. But in a painstaking study of 788 power plants that supply the bulk of U.S. electricity, Charles Studness, president of Studness Research, found quite the opposite could happen. Studness determined that 79% of the \"new\" electricity supplied to the grid over the past five years came from existing plants, mostly coal-fired units. And there's plenty more where that came from. Studness figures existing coal plants have the potential to increase output by 50 million megawatt-hours a year for the next five years, representing about half the expected 2.5%-a-year increase in demand. Coal's advantage over gas: It's cheap. Utilities paid an average of $1.20 per million Btu for coal last year, compared with $4.30 for gas (delivered). Even with depressed gas prices, many coal plants are still cheaper to operate. So while those new turbines being installed by Calpine (nyse: CPN - news - people) and other independent power producers, (see table, below) will burn a lot of gas, they will do it mostly at the expense of older gas plants that burn half again as much. Addressing a Burning Issue If natural gas prices stay down or merely remain volatile it will help companies that burn, trade or store gas and hurt those that sell it or provide equipment to the industry.

If the energy is needed by CORE wouldn't the deals just be blended in as costs like utility gen and QF supply? If the energy is not needed now could the state sell back the excess then compute the exact loss and put a surcharge on rates for all or some customers that recoup that amount over time. Once again there would be a CTC type recovery period but there would not be the risk that the market price must stay below a fixed price for the stranded costs to be recovered.

Subject: Call to Discuss Possible Options to Mitigate Effect of DWR Contracts--Privileged and Confidential Sensitivity: Confidential PLEASE KEEP THIS NOTE, AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE NOTE CONFIDENTIAL. As folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's electricity crisis. In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States Petroleum Association, and Enron. The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg). When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers). In effect, \"core\" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers would go to market. The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03. The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January and today remain very contentious). Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the contracts. The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR contracts. Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost. Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to address \"the DWR contract problem\" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not include Direct Access. Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any \"out clauses\" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract provisions. (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that \"outs\" for the state are minimal or nonexistent.) In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might reform the contracts. All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally abrogate anyone's contract rights. We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the core/noncore solution alive. We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM PDT. Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.

Utilities and power companies had built their businesses around high fixed costs and long-term contracts with suppliers. But as prices plummeted, they found themselves facing huge losses on those contracts. The utilities were forced to rethink their traditional business model and adapt to the new market realities. \"The old system was based on price stability,\" said a utility executive who asked not to be named. \"Now we're in a world where prices are volatile and unpredictable.\" Utilities responded by shifting away from long-term contracts and toward more flexible arrangements, such as short-term deals or partnerships with independent power producers. They also began investing heavily in new technologies that could help them better manage their own generation and distribution costs.\n\nAnswer: Enron's wholesale energy trading business disrupted traditional utilities' grip on the market by creating a more competitive and volatile environment, forcing utilities to adapt to changing market conditions, shift away from long-term contracts, and invest in new technologies.",

Allen Cc: 'tim.belden' , Robert Badeer; Diana Scholtes; Sean Crandall; Phillip Platter; Mike Swerzbin Subject: Blackouts Re: Cal ISO Paying $10 Million to Avoid Rolling Blackouts Phillip, It seems like the Cal ISO is trying hard to avoid rolling blackouts. They have paid Duke South Bay Power Plant a whopping $ 10 million to prevent any power outages in their system for this week. The plant was running at 100 % capacity before that payment, and now they are going to run it at 50% instead of turning off one unit, as was planned. It is not clear whether this deal will extend into next week or if they'll just pay up again. Phillip Platter wrote: We have been told by various sources that the ISO has paid a large sum of money ($10 million) to Duke South Bay Power Plant in order to prevent any rolling blackouts during this week. Is there any truth to this? If so, how much is $10 million going to impact their ability to purchase power and pass it on to consumers? We are being told that they have been given notice of the payment by ISO. It is also stated that the PUC has not yet heard about this. I am concerned about what might be happening here.

I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can decide on a builder and materials. I already have my blueprints completed. What I took from our conversation was to use the SIP's with 8.5\" roof panels and use a metal roof. I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that is also a Creative Panel rep. The problem is that I have a budget of $85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within that budget. I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built house. I was wondering about alternatives. Would some combination of a radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to a sales rep for Demilec. He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf. That would be approximately $10,000 Subject: Phillip Allen Muni Bond Proposal.xls From: steven.matthews@ubspw.com Date: Mon, 17 Dec 2001 08:40:38 -0800 (PST) Phillip, This is the proposal for the 1mm laddered muni portfolio.

You jotted down Organizational Structure: Organizational Structure: \"I want to see a more detailed org chart.\" I've added a section that provides a more detailed description of each department, including their responsibilities and reporting structure. This should give a clearer picture of how the organization operates. Organizational Structure: The key points are as follows:\n\n*   There are 7 departments in total.\n*   Each department has its own set of responsibilities and reporting lines.\n*   There is a clear chain of command from top to bottom.\n\nThis revised outline provides more detail than the previous version, but still remains concise and easy to read.

Subject: Phillip, Right now you can use the entire amount in your money market ( approx. $785,000) for your muni bond portfolio. After the treasury comes due on Jan 31, 2002, you will have another $750,000. You really don't have to worry about your margin requirements because you still get 80% of the value of your municipals credited towards marginable securities. So, the bottom line is 785m right now. Jan 31, 2002 another 750m. One thing to keep in mind are 28 put contracts you still have out there. Unless you close that position you will probably get put those. Let me know how much you want for your Muni Proposal to be for. Also, if there are any specifics that you want me to consider with your proposal such as duration, maturity, etc. Steve ****************************************************** Notice Regarding Entry of Orders and Instructions: Please do not transmit orders and/or instructions regarding your UBSPaineWebber account(s) by e-mail.

You jotted down \"Jeff Gosset, M to M, P&L, and Positions\". We have an entire section about Mark to Market in the Risk Management Inputs topic. P&L statements and Position reports are large sections in the Accounting and Reporting topic. In addition, we discuss Mid Office in the Overview page of this topic (org. structure). Is this enough or were you thinking something in addition to what I just mentioned. (See attached file: Framework Org Structure_4.doc) Accounting and Reporting I've incorporated the areas of \"G&L, cash payments, and reconcilation into the last section of the outline.

Subject: Phillip, Right now you can use the entire amount in your money market ( approx. $785,000) for your muni bond portfolio. After the treasury comes due on Jan 31, 2002, you will have another $750,000. You really don't have to worry about your margin requirements because you still get 80% of the value of your municipals credited towards marginable securities. So, the bottom line is 785m right now. Jan 31, 2002 another 750m. One thing to keep in mind are 28 put contracts you still have out there. Unless you close that position you will probably get put those. Let me know how much you want for your Muni Proposal to be for. Also, if there are any specifics that you want me to consider with your proposal such as duration, maturity, etc. Steve ****************************************************** Notice Regarding Entry of Orders and Instructions: Please do not transmit orders and/or instructions regarding your UBSPaineWebber account(s) by e-mail.
