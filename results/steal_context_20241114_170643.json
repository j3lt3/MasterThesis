The context you've given seems to be the start of our conversation. If you'd like to continue from here, I'd be delighted to help!\n\nSo, it appears we're discussing the concept of voltage in a software development cycle. That's an interesting analogy! In electrical engineering, voltage refers to the \"pressure\" or energy driving electric current.\n\nIf I were to interpret this question literally, I might say that the voltage on our software development cycle could be seen as a measure of the creative pressure, innovation, and momentum driving our team's productivity and efficiency. However, in the context of software development, we don't have direct measures like voltage, but we can consider factors such as:\n\n1. **Innovation**: How often do we introduce new ideas, technologies, or processes to improve our development cycle?\n2. **Efficiency**: What methods are we using to streamline tasks, reduce waste, and optimize our workflows?\n3. **Motivation**: Are our team members engaged, motivated, and empowered to make decisions that impact the project's success?\n\nTo juice up innovation and efficiency in software development, I'd suggest:\n\n1. **Encourage experimentation**: Provide a safe space for team members to try new approaches, technologies, or tools.\n2. **Foster open communication**: Regularly solicit feedback, ideas, and concerns from everyone on the team.\n3. **Emphasize learning and growth**: Prioritize knowledge sharing, workshops, and training sessions to improve skills and stay up-to-date with industry trends.\n\nThese are just some initial thoughts. If you'd like to explore this topic further or provide more context, I'm here to help!",

Here are the main points from their conversation 1. Anglelides Certain that SoCal Will Go Bankrupt Corroborating our line over the past four months, Anglelides stated with confidence that SoCal would go bankrupt and that \"he was surprised they hadn't already.\" He noted that the only reason they haven't yet is that \"they were too stupid to ring-fence the parent\" and that \"their two biggest equity holders were screaming not to do it.\" He added that the Davis/SoCal MOU is dead and that all the \"Plan B's\" are \"speculative\" at best. He also thought that SoCal was being \"naive if they thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankruptcy court.\" 2. Bond Issuance- $12B Not Enough Angelides conceded that a $12B bond issue would not be enough to buy power for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $18-24B. The only reason they didn't issue more is that Angelides felt that \"$12B was all the market could handle.\" The current game plan for bonds assumes an average peak price for power of $400/MWh, which Angelides said explains the difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from State Comptroller's Kathleen Connell's office. 3. New Generator Construction Anglelides was explicit that the California Public Power Authority (authorized by the legislature last week) will \"build plants and not stop until we [California] has a 10-15% capacity cushion above expected demand. Angelides expects the state to be \"5-10% short on power all summer.\"",

I'd like to see how much gas demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, especially compared to all gas consumption.

Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter. Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop.\n\nStill, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient.

            "context": "Subject:  From: phillip.allen@enron.com Date: Mon, 22 Jan 2001 01:24:00 -0800 (PST) By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City Star Date: 01/20/01 22:15 As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas storage number. The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. \"Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,\" said William Burson, a trader. \"It makes the market for natural gas.\" But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality. \"It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what we are reporting,\" McGill said. As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at Wall Street. Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for the rise in gas prices. \"It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,\" Adik told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes. Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared. \"We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,\" said Paul Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. \"There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to change,\" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. Hot topic Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In many circles, little else is discussed. The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as well. The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. \"It's the talk of the town here,\" he said. A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by customers. But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter. There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas markets. \"It's all about the weather,\" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile commodity in the world. Setting the price In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had widespread influence over gas prices. The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what they pay for the gas they expect to use. There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge of natural gas. But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time. As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's weekly storage numbers. Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter. Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. \"I was getting worried,\" he said. Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet.

Diluted earnings per share were $.22, down 59 percent from a year ago. Net revenues on a managed basis totaled $5.5 billion, down one percent from $5.6 billion a year ago. The company's return on equity was 14.2 percent. Results for the third quarter were negatively affected by two significant items: a previously announced restructuring charge of $352 million pre-tax ($232 million after-tax) and the impacts from the September 11th terrorist attacks. The September 11th events resulted in certain one-time costs and business interruption losses, including: provisions related to credit exposures to travel industry service establishments, insurance claims, and waived finance charges and late fees. The combination of these items totaled approximately $98 million pre-tax ($65 million after-tax). The company also incurred costs of approximately $42 million since September 11th, which are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequently, these costs did not impact the quarterly results. These include the cost of duplicate facilities and equipment associated with the relocation of the company's offices in lower Manhattan and certain other business recovery expenses. Costs associated with the damage to the company's offices, extra operating expenses and business interruption losses are still being evaluated. The company expects that a substantial portion ofgh its Ists and losses will be covered by insurance. The third quarter restructuring charge includes severance costs for the elimination of approximately 6,100 jobs and asset impairment and other costs, all relating to the consolidation and reorganization of certain business units, the scale back of corporate lending in certain regions, the migration of certain processes to lower cost locations, the outsourcing of certain activities, and the transition of certain processing and service functions to the Internet. These initiatives are expected to produce expense savings of approximately $325 million in 2002. A portion of these savings is expected to flow through to earnings in the form of improved operating expense margins and the rest is expected to be reinvested back into high-growth areas of the business. In addition to the activities related to the restructuring charge, the company made strong progress on its global reengineering efforts initiated in the first half of the year and, as of September 30, had realized savings in excess of $700 million. Net income for the third quarter, adjusted for the restructuring and one-time costs related to September 11th, was approximately $595 million, down 19 percent. On a similar basis, earnings per share were $.45, down 17 percent. The company's adjusted return on equity was 16.7 percent. \"While we were on target to meet prior consensus for third quarter earnings, the terrorist attacks obviously had a significant impact on the overall economy and we saw clear evidence of that as consumer spending, business travel and investment activity slowed after September 11th,\" said Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive officer, American Express Company. \"In light of the weak economy and financial markets, we are moving aggressively to lower our operating expenses. The progress we are making on our reengineering initiatives has freed up substantial resources for investment in our businesses with the strongest growth potential. This, along with the anticipated benefit of lower interest rates and the strategies in place to grow our franchise, positions us well to benefit when we see even a modest improvement in the economy.\" Travel Related Services (TRS) reported quarterly net income of $248 million, down 51 percent from $507 million in the third quarter a year ago. Included in third quarter results are $195 million pre-tax ($127 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Also included in the results are $87 million pre-tax ($57 million after-tax) of one-time costs and waived fees directly related to the September 11th terrorist attacks. Excluding these costs and the restructuring charge, TRS' net income would have been $432 million, down 15 percent from the third quarter last year. TRS' net revenues rose two percent, as growth in loans and fee revenues were partly offset by a three percent decline in billed business and a 28 percent fall in travel sales. These declines reflect a substantial decrease in corporate travel and entertainment spending and consumer travel since September 11th. Prior to September, billed business growth for the quarter was about two percent as higher consumer and small business spending offset a decline in corporate travel and entertainment spending. Net finance charge revenues were higher, due to balance growth and wider net interest yields. This increase reflects a smaller percentage of loan balances on introductory rates and the benefit of declining interest rates during the quarter. The provision for losses on the lending portfolios grew as a result of higher volumes and an increase in U.S. lending write-off rates and delinquencies. Marketing and promotion expenses were lower as TRS scaled back certain marketing efforts in light of the weaker business environment. Operating expenses rose, reflecting increased Cardmember loyalty programs and business volumes. These expenses were partly offset by the benefits of reengineering and cost-control efforts. The above discussion presents TRS results \"on a managed basis\" as if there had been no securitization transactions, which conforms to industry practice. The attached financials present TRS results on both a managed and reported basis. Net income is the same in both formats. On a reported basis, TRS' results included securitization gains of $29 million pre-tax ($19 million after-tax) and $26 million pre-tax ($17 million after-tax) in the third quarters of 2001 and 2000, respectively. These gains were offset by expenses related to card acquisition activities and therefore had no material impact on net income or total expenses. American Express Financial Advisors (AEFA) reported quarterly net income of $145 million, down 46 percent from $269 million in the third quarter a year ago. Net revenues decreased 14 percent. Included in third quarter results are $62 million pre-tax ($41 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier and $11 million pre-tax ($8 million after-tax) of insurance claims directly related to September 11th. Excluding these items, AEFA's net income would have been $194 million, down 28 percent from last year. AEFA results reflect continued weakness in equity markets and narrower spreads on the investment portfolio. The weakened equity markets led to significantly lower asset levels and lower sales of investment products. As a result, management and distribution fees fell 15 percent. Operating expenses, excluding the above-mentioned charges, decreased four percent from a year ago due primarily to lower sales commissions and continued reengineering and cost-control initiatives. As of September 30th, approximately 4 percent of the company's $33 billion investment portfolio consisted of high-yield securities, down from 12 percent a year ago and 8 percent last quarter. The reduction reflects the activities to date to lower the risk profile of the portfolio and concentrate on stronger credits. American Express Bank (AEB) reported a quarterly net loss of $43 million, compared with $7 million of net income a year ago. Included in third quarter results are $84 million pre-tax ($57 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Excluding these charges, AEB's net income would have been $15 million, approximately double the earnings recorded in the same period last year. While AEB sustained damage to its premises due to the September 11th terrorist attacks, the costs are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequently, these costs did not impact AEB's quarterly results. AEB's business results reflect strong performance in Personal Financial Services and Private Banking. Results also benefited from lower funding costs and lower operating expenses as a result of AEB's reengineering efforts. These were offset in part by higher provisions for losses due to higher Personal Financial Services loan balances, and lower revenue from Corporate Banking as the company continues to shift its focus to Personal Financial Services and Private Banking. Corporate and Other reported net expenses of $52 million, compared with $46 million a year ago. Included in third quarter 2001 results are $11 million pre-tax ($7 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier.

The code you provided is not a Python script, but rather HTML code for an email template.\n\nTo design a better email template, consider the following best practices:\n\n* Use a clear and consistent structure\n* Avoid using tables to layout your content\n* Use a responsive design to ensure that your email looks good on various devices\n* Keep it simple and concise\n\nHere's a simple example of how you might redesign this table-based template into a more modern, responsive HTML structure:\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Example Email</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n    <!-- Header Section -->\n    <div class=\"header\">\n        <h1>Welcome to our email!</h1>\n    </div>\n\n    <!-- Main Content Section -->\n    <div class=\"main-content\">\n        <p>This is a sample paragraph of text.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <!-- Call-to-Action Button -->\n    <button class=\"cta-button\">Click me!</button>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\nThis example uses basic HTML structure and styles to create a simple email template. Note that you would need to add more content, styles, and functionality (such as responsive design) to make this template useful.\n\nRegarding your original question about how to \"extract\" data from the table, I assume you meant to extract specific values or columns from the table? If so, please provide a clear example of what you are trying to achieve.",

Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the season.\n\nAnswer - GG Alexander has been a revelation in his first two starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not the recommended choice.\n\nQuestion - Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA \nWhich two receivers should I start this weekend, out of Todd Pinkston, Bill Schroeder, Chris Carter, Terry Glenn and James McKnight?

Question - Chris Trautman, LaCrosse, WI I am stuck on my last starter. Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the season. Answer - GG Alexander has been a revelation in his first two starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems. Question - Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA Should I start Rod Gardner or Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is looking better each week. Answer - GG Gardner's huge day means two things. One, he gains instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants' No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He'll be facing Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week. Neither player looks like a great start, but we'll go with Hilliard because of his experience and continuing improvement. Question - John Kersey, Denver, CO I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB - Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson? Answer - GG Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with the hotter player, and that would be Thomas. Tip of the Week Walter Mathis, Pompano Beach, FL: Remember that football is a game that is fueled by emotion. Sometimes, emotions override matchups. Curtis Martin will always rip holes in the Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle. And in divisional games, big players do well. Don't be surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh. This message has been provided free of charge and free of obligation.
